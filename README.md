The notebook `PROG8245_Lab2 - Data Collection & Pre-Processing.ipynb`  applies a 12-step data engineering pipeline to a synthetic e-commerce dataset. It includes data loading, cleaning, transformation, enrichment, and analysis. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was used to structure logic with reusable methods. Aggregations by city and channel provide quick business insights.
